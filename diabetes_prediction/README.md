# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes using the scikit-learn diabetes dataset. The model uses Logistic Regression to classify patients as either having diabetes or not.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics and classification report
- Feature importance visualization

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the prediction model:
   ```
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

The script will output the model's accuracy and classification report, and save a feature importance plot as 'feature_importance.png'.
